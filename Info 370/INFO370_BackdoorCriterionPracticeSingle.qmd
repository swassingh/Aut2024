# Practice with DAGs

## Create a DAG

Replace the code chunk below with one that would create a DAG to represent the causal system that you need to consider if you wanted to estimate the effect of *age (A)* on the *number of skin cancer cells detected (C)* for adult humans. You should include at least the following variables:

*  Age
*  Skin cancer cells
*  Income
*  Health insurance
*  Sunscreen use
*  Sunburn frequency
*  Itchy skin

For creating the DAG, you can rely on your own judgments or you can look online for evidence that points to relationships between specific variables if you are unsure.

graph LR
	A(Age) --> C(Skin Cancer Cells)
	A --> I(Income)
	I --> H(Health Insurance)
	H --> C
	A --> S(Sunscreen Use)
	S --> C
	A --> F(Sunburn Frequency)
	F --> C
	C --> K(Itchy Skin)

	style C fill:white, stroke-width:0px
	style I fill:white, stroke-width:0px
	style H fill:white, stroke-width:0px
	style S fill:white, stroke-width:0px
	style F fill:white, stroke-width:0px
	style K fill:white, stroke-width:0px
```

## Interpret the DAG

Identify each of the following! Depending on your DAG, there may be different numbers of mediators, colliders, and confounding variables!

The treatment variable:

*  Age

The response variable:

*  Skin Cancer Cells

Confounders:

*  Income
*  Health Insurance
*  Sunscreen Use
*  Sunburn Frequency

Mediators:

*  Income
*  Health Insurance
*  Sunscreen Use
*  Sunburn Frequency

Colliders:

*  Itchy Skin

What are the backdoor paths in your DAG?:

1. A -> I -> H -> C
2. A -> S -> C
3. A -> F -> C

How would you close each backdoor path you identified?

1. Control for Income and Health Insurance to close the path A -> I -> H -> C
2. Control for Sunscreen Use to close the path A -> S -> C
3. Control for Sunburn Frequency to close the path A -> F -> C

Would you be able to satisfy the backdoor criteria with control?

*  Yes, because controlling for Income, Health Insurance, Sunscreen Use, and Sunburn Frequency would block all backdoor paths.
*  No, because if any of these variables are not controlled for, the backdoor paths would remain open.

Would you be able to satisfy the backdoor criteria with control *if you did not record whether or not individuals regularly use sunscreen*?

*  Yes, because you can still control for Income, Health Insurance, and Sunburn Frequency to block the remaining backdoor paths.
*  No, because not controlling for Sunscreen Use leaves the path A -> S -> C open.

Would you be able to satisfy the backdoor criteria with control *if you did not record the frequency of sunburns for individuals*?

*  Yes, because you can still control for Income, Health Insurance, and Sunscreen Use to block the remaining backdoor paths.
*  No, because not controlling for Sunburn Frequency leaves the path A -> F -> C open.

Based off the information above, imagine that you have a data frame that includes information for all of the available variables. What would the lm() function look like that would let you do your best job at estimating the effect?

lm(Skin_Cancer_Cells ~ Age + Income + Health_Insurance + Sunscreen_Use + Sunburn_Frequency, data = data_frame)
